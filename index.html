                <br />I am a second year Computer Sciene student at University of Toronto Scarborough, currently enrolled in the Software Engineering stream.
                <br /> <br /> I have started computer sciences classes since IGCSE which was in grade 9. But my interest for computers started way back when I was as young as grade 2.
                As my father is also a computer scientist, I own my own computer science grade 2. At the same time, I started to gain interest with photography in grade 6, thus when
                ICT classes in grade 7 started, teaching us photoshop and other designing tools, I gained even more interest in design, game design and software development.
                Not only I want to be able to create something that is aesthetic to the eyes, but I have always wondered how common problems seen in life can be solved with the help
                of computers - What kind of solution can I create using my creativity and the knowledge I have about technology?
