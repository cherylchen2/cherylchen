                I have started computer sciences classes since IGCSE which was in grade 9. But my interest for computers started way back when I was as young as grade 2.
                As my father is also a computer scientist, he has influenced me to always think creatively for solutions. 
                What kind of solution can I create using my creativity and the knowledge I have about technology?
