                        <p>For the 3 months of working in VeryStar in the Project team, I believe that not only I have learned on technical aspects of
                            project development cycles, but I have also learned a lot about the importaance of networking, communication and of the local cultures.
                            Although a lot of times I hoped that I could have been more engaged in their projects and to learn as much as I could, I have learned
                            a lot of the other principles such as being patient and independent. Before my internship, I have always been a person taht would
                            immediately ask another person for help when a difficult or confusing task was encountered. However, in this internship I have learned 
                            that everyone has their own roles and they were all working hard in their own roles; thus I have learned to be more independent by doing
                            more research, be patient with myself and think, discuss with other colleagues before asking my supervisor if I still had any questions.</p>
