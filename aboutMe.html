    <h1>About Me.</h1>
    <h4>
        I am currently a third year Computer Science student in University of Toronto Scarborough, in the Software Engineer Co-op stream. 
    </h4>
    <p>
        I am from HongKong, however, I have moved to Shanghai when I was 8 years old and have since studied in a Singporean International school, which may or may not have resulted in my weird accent. I have gotten guesses like:
        <list>
            <li>Singaporean</li>
            <li>British-Australian</li>
            <li>Taiwanese</li>
            <li>Fujian</li>
            <li>
                .
                .
            </li>
        </list>
        Why does Computer Science interests me? It has first amazed me when I realized how much you can create with computer and with imagination
         - Giving you the ability to create something that might not even exist in real life in the Virtual world;
        Or create something that will drastically change the lifestlye of the society, to create something that will improve the quality of life;
        To make people smile :)

        I would say I am the type of people that would like to learn - just learning anything: any skills, arts, sports, languages. Learning is 
        a process that allows me to explore and learn about the world around me. Outside of school, I like to cook, do some baking for my friends,
        play the piano, sing to it, play the ukelele, sing to it, play the guitar.. Sing to it. I also do some digital drawings, sing-, just kidding :).
        As for sports, I like to cycle, play volleyball, and a lot of rock climbing.

        In highschool, I have participated in Girls Volleyabll D2, Girls Soccer D1 and D2 Badminton Doubles. Also, I have been in the Intramural Girls D2
        Volleyball team for UTSC in my first year before I started rock climbing. Being able to be in a team where we work together to reach our goals
        was one of the best memories I have in my life, and the lessons I learn from them, I will never forget.

        Something that I absolutely love right now, is the University club that I am in, UTSC Capture. UTSC Capture is a photography, videography and modelling
        club where we aim to create a close and accepting community for anyone who are interested in anything related, or even not related but would like
        to just join us for fun. I humbly run as the Vice President for the club, planning and running events, to help other students, to lead the team to
        grow as a whole to become the better versions of ourselves. I am glad that I was given the opportunity to run as the Vice President as it has given
        me a lot of different experiences and new knowledges, it has allowed me to practice my organization, management and communication skills. But in my
        believe, something that is irreplaceable is everyone that I have met in the club, ranging from past executives, the current executive team, and all
        the students I have met.
