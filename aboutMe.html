        <p class="introMainText" style="text-align: center;">
                I am from HongKong, however, I have moved to Shanghai when I was 8 years old and have since studied in a Singporean International school, and 
                currently studying in University of Toronto Scarborough as a 3rd year Software Engineer student.

        <p class="introMainText" style="text-align: center;">
            It has first amazed me ever since I realized how much you can create with computer and with imagination
            - I always enjoy being able to create something that might not even exist in real life in the Virtual world;
           Or create something that will drastically change the lifestlye of the society, to create something that will improve
           the quality of life; To make people smile :) I also love meeting and working with people because it always brings
           me so many new experiences and memories

            I would say I am the type of people that would like to learn - just learning anything: any skills, arts, sports, languages. Learning is 
            a process that allows me to explore and learn about the world around me. Outside of school, I like to cook, do some baking for my friends,
            play the piano, sing to it, play the ukelele, sing to it, play the guitar.. Sing to it. I also do some digital drawings, sing-, just kidding :).
            As for sports, I like to cycle, play volleyball, and A LOT of rock climbing.

        <p class="introMainText" style="text-align: center;">
            In highschool, I have participated in Girls Volleyabll D2, Girls Soccer D1 and D2 Badminton Doubles. Also, I have been in the Intramural Girls D2
            Volleyball team for UTSC in my first year before I started rock climbing. Being able to be in a team where we work together to reach our goals
            was one of the best memories I have in my life, and the lessons I learn from them, I will never forget.

            Something that I absolutely love right now, is the University club that I am in, UTSC Capture. UTSC Capture is a photography, videography and modelling
            club where we aim to create a close and accepting community for anyone who are interested in anything related, or even not related but would like
            to just join us for fun. I humbly run as the Vice President for the club, planning and running events, to help other students, to lead the team to
            grow as a whole to become the better versions of ourselves. I am glad that I was given the opportunity to run as the Vice President as it has given
            me a lot of different experiences and new knowledges, it has allowed me to practice my organization, management and communication skills. But in my
            believe, something that is irreplaceable is everyone that I have met in the club, ranging from past executives, the current executive team, and all
            the students I have met.
